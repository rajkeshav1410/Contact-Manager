# About
A Contact Manager is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) to manage and store contact information. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete contacts. The user interface is built with ReactJS and interacts with the server-side API built with ExpressJS and NodeJS to perform CRUD operations on the data stored in MongoDB. The application provides (future updates will provide) features like searching and filtering contacts, adding tags and notes to each contact, and sorting the contact list based on different criteria. The MERN stack provides a full-stack JavaScript solution, making it a popular choice for building modern web applications.
